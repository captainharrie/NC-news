### Setup

To start using this repo, clone the project and set up two .env files in the root directory: `.env.development` and `.env.test`, pointing to your development and test databases respectively. View the `.env-example` file for an example, and the `./db/setup.sql` file for the expected database names. Ensure that these new files are ignored in `.gitignore`.
